do fast execution on raydium (at one point i think i was one of the fastest on raydium shit coins and fresh listings)
Run pools/index.ts independently of main.py

python3 main.py <pool_id> to execute a trade 

Sorry this is super rough, I ran this as like a manual executor that was just way faster than getting into the book through Raydium's website. If you have any Q's hit me up on TG I will try to help -- I whipped it together quite roughly as I was trying to exploit the sol shitcoin mania of Nov/December 2023
