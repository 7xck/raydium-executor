do fast execution on raydium (at one point i think i was one of the fastest on raydium shit coins and fresh listings)
Run pools/index.ts independently of main.py. The original purpose of this project was to get an executor that can instantaneously trade on new listings on Raydium. Trading new listings on Raydium using the website interface is nearly impossible, and often times the website is behind the chain (new listings don't show up).

python3 main.py <pool_id> to execute a trade 

Sorry this is super rough, I ran this as like a manual executor that was just way faster than getting into the book through Raydium's website. If you have any Q's hit me up on TG I will try to help -- I whipped it together quite roughly as I was trying to exploit the sol shitcoin mania of Nov/December 2023. I also found using Raydium with Python SUPER difficult


Buy me a coffee with some SOL if you get some use out of this :+1: BSkJRoXu1GLvw7pRVXDm5JEDdg56HjKcRxeBa1emUqVu
