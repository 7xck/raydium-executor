See code commit history for a much more detailed (and rough) version of this code base. This code should serve as a useful base for your automated trading project on Raydium. With some tweaks, it could also be a significantly faster executor than some other paid versions that are available on the market.

Always happy to answer questions. See my telegram on my profile for a primary point of contact.
